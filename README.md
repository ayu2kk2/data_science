Predicting Bank Term Deposit Subscription: A Data Science Approach

This project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies customers likely to subscribe to a bank term deposit. The analysis was conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

To achieve this objective, two different machine learning models were evaluated, selecting the best-performing one for final predictions. A thorough Preliminary Data Analysis (PDA) was performed to clean the dataset, ensuring data quality. Bi-variate and multivariate analyses were conducted to extract meaningful insights using various visualizations, such as graphs and plots.

For modeling, a Logistic Regression model was initially applied to predict the test dataset. However, considering potential nonlinear relationships within the data, a Decision Tree Classifier was also implemented. Rigorous steps were taken in data preparation, feature selection, and model tuning. Various evaluation metrics were used to assess model performance, ensuring reliability and robustness.

As a result, the final predictive model achieved an accuracy exceeding 90%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying potential customers for subscription.
